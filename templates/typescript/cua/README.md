# Kernel Typescript Sample App - CUA

This is a Kernel application that demonstrates using the Computer Using Agent (CUA) from OpenAI.

It generally follows the [OpenAI CUA Sample App Reference](https://github.com/openai/openai-cua-sample-app) and uses Playwright via Kernel for browser automation.
Also makes use of the latest OpenAI SDK format, and has local equivalent to Kernel methods for local testing before deploying on Kernel.

See the [docs](https://onkernel.com/docs/quickstart) for information.
