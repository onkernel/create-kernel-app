# Kernel Typscript Sample App - Computer Use

This is a simple Kernel application that implements a prompt loop using Anthropic Computer Use.

It generally follows the [Anthropic Reference Implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo) but replaces `xodotool` and `gnome-screenshot` with Playwright.

See the [docs](https://docs.onkernel.com/quickstart) for information.
